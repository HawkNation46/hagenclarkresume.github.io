	<h2>Sports Fliming for NSU</h2>
	<p>I got this job at Northern because of my passion for it in high school. While this job, I have done pretty much the basic part of it from setting up the equipment to fliming games. Although my future for advancements through this job is high up there and it has allowed me to work on communication skills when coordinating my placement of my camera to multi-tasking during the game.</p>

	<h2>Outside Yard TM  & Load Builder for Menards</h2>
	<p>I was able to obtain a job at Menards in December 2020. When I working in the outside yard, my main goal was to help customer find their products as well as take care of putting away product including lumber, drywall etc via a forklift. After about a year, I transfered over to being a load builder and I am in charge of building customer delivers as well as locate, find and log customer special orders into our databases.</p>
